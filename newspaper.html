            <p id="content">Donald Trump seized the opportunity to mock President Joe Biden's slip-up during his 'Big Boy' press conference. Following Biden's earlier gaffe of mistakenly referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as 'President Putin', the POTUS sparked another round of internet mockery with yet another embarrassing moment. As he began to take questions, the president stumbled almost immediately. This time, Biden left the crowd baffled by referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as 'Trump'.  <br>“Look, I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if I think she’s not qualified to be president,” Biden said. The President was said to be discussing concerns regarding Vice President Kamala Harris's capacity to win against Donald Trump should she be the main contender.</p>

            <p id="content">Sunak, who resigned on Friday, kept his Richmond and Northallerton seat comfortably with 47.5% of the vote, but Tory colleague and Britain’s shortest-serving PM Liz Truss lost her seat in Parliament.
                Sunak accepted the responsibility for his party’s loss and said voters had delivered a “sobering verdict”.
                In a post on X Indian PM Narendra Modi thanked Sunak for deepening ties with India.<br>The landslide means a happy weekend for Labour, but they have serious work ahead.
                The country’s electorate is impatient for change against a gloomy backdrop of economic malaise, mounting distrust in institutions and a fraying social fabric.
                In fact, economic troubles led the Tories to the slaughter this time.</p>

            <p id="content">Uttar Pradesh government agencies have launched intensive searches across the state and in neighbouring Rajasthan and Haryana to trace Hathras stampede key accused Devprakash Madhukar.
                A senior government official told PTI that they are also looking for preacher Surajpal (alias Narayan Sakar Hari / Bhole Baba) for questioning in the case. <br>While Madhukar, the ‘mukhya sevadar’ (chief organiser of the satsang), is the only named accused in the FIR, Bhole Baba was not mentioned as accused.
                Besides Madhukar, “several unidentified organisers” were also booked in the case, lodged at the Sikandra Rao Police Station and six suspects have been arrested so far.
                “No one has been given a clean chit. The investigation is on and government agencies are searching for the main accused and the preacher to question them,” the official told PTI.</p>

                “Over-centralising exams, where a single test determines a student’s future, is fraught with risks. In engineering, for instance, moving from single-threaded to distributed systems improved reliability because if one part fails, others can still function,” he said.</p>

            <p id="content" >Bharti Airtel on Friday said reports claiming the data of 37.5 crore subscribers has been hacked are false.
                Unverified reports had said Airtel user data, including phone number, email, address, date of birth, father’s name and Aadhaar number, was up for sale on the dark web.
                The company said, “This is nothing short of a desperate attempt to tarnish Airtel’s reputation by vested interests”.<br>The breach was claimed by X user ‘Dark Web Informer’.
                The handle identified ‘xenZen’ as the seller of Airtel user data on a community called BreachForums.
                It said xenZen was demanding $50,000 for the information.</p>

            <p id="content" >Kejriwal has applied for bail, arguing that his arrest by the CBI was unwarranted and that his detention is unlawful.
                Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, representing Kejriwal, said the AAP leader is not a flight risk and not a terrorist, and the CBI arrested him after he got bail in the ED's money laundering case.
                Singhvi highlighted Kejriwal’s strong societal ties and advocated for interim relief in this matter.<br>Advocate DP Singh, representing the CBI, objected to Kejriwal's direct appeal to the high court without first seeking bail from the trial court.
                The high court took note of the objection and said "the contention shall be considered at the time of arguments".
                "Higher courts often advise going back to lower courts when an alternative remedy is available. This prevents clogging higher courts and allows us to review the trial court's decision first" Justice Krishna said.</p>
